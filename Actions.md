# Defining Actions

## 1. Abatement Spending Decision

- Each country chooses an abatement spending variable $a_i$ every year.
- A higher allocation to abatement (i.e., a larger $a_i$ reduces the resources available for production $(M - a_i)$, thereby lowering short-term economic output while reducing emissions and climate damage.

## 2. Agreement Compliance Decision

- In each period, aside from setting their abatement spending, countries also decide whether to comply with an international climate agreement.
- The decision is binary: **Comply** or **Not Comply**.
- Choosing to comply may incur additional compliance costs but can yield benefits such as improved international cooperation, incentives, or avoidance of sanctions. Conversely, non-compliance might offer short-term economic gains at the expense of long-term reputation and negotiation leverage.

## 3. Negotiation Actions

- Countries can engage in negotiations over key issues including:
  - Tariff $t$
  - Committed abatement spending $a_i$
  - Climate finance or abatement subsidies
  - The commitment regarding agreement compliance
- Negotiations are conducted via a limited number of rounds (e.g., 3 rounds) using simple actions such as “concede” or “stand firm” to reach mutually beneficial outcomes.
